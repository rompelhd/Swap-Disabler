  <strong>Swap-Disabler</strong> is a Magisk module designed to disable swap at system startup. This module is particularly beneficial for devices with ample RAM, where swap usage is unnecessary and may even hinder performance. By disabling swap, <strong>Swap-Disabler</strong> offers the following advantages:

  - **Extended Flash Memory Lifespan**: Frequent writes to swap partitions can accelerate flash storage wear. Disabling swap significantly reduces this degradation, helping to prolong the lifespan of your device's memory.
  
  - **Eco-Friendly**: By minimizing unnecessary writes to storage, the module contributes to reducing electronic waste, making it a sustainable choice for environmentally conscious users.
  
  - **Performance Improvement**: In certain conditions, particularly for devices with substantial RAM, disabling swap can lead to better overall system performance by avoiding reliance on slower storage-based memory.
  
  - **Flash Memory Durability**: Flash memory typically has between 3,000 and 100,000 write cycles. Disabling swap reduces the number of write cycles used for virtual memory, potentially increasing the lifespan of your device's storage by 20% to 40%, depending on usage.
